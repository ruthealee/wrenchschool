#Wrenchschool: 8 Weeks Ops Basics Course

## What is it?
The intent is to have an 8 session course that covers the essentials of operations, with a focus on linux systems. 
At the end of 8 sessions attendees should understand the interaction between different components of computers and the operating system, as well as larger scale architectures around web technologies and distributed systems. 

The emphasis here is on general concepts not specific how to guides of which a large number exist. 

## Can I contribute?
Eventually yes, right now not accepting PRs 

## When will this be complete?
A mystery
