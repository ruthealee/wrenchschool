# INTRODUCTORY LEVEL RESOURCES
------------------------------

* Edx.org & The Linux Foundation LFS101 Course
   This is a free self paced online course that will introduce you to some Linux basics. There are some areas the course is very good on and others where you may need to fill in some additional reading to clarify concepts. Find it [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-0#!)

* Eli the Computer Guy 
   Youtube videos covering some really basic Linux tasks. The full Linux playlist is [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD6B6473ACF32C59D) but I also recommend his servers and networking playlists.
* VirtualBox Beginners Guide
   Lifehacker has a nice guide for how to set up a VirtualBox Linux instance on your home machine [here](http://lifehacker.com/5204434/the-beginners-guide-to-creating-virtual-machines-with-virtualbox)

* Amazon Guide for connecting to a Cloud Server
   AWS has some good documentation on how to use PuTTY with EC2 instances [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html). The Linux foundation course should have helped you work out how to connect to your Linux cloud instances, or to local ones using virtualbox on your workstation.

* Digital Ocean's Server Setup Guide
   For your first server set up Digital ocean has a good guide. Remember, you don't need to host with them, there's other free providers you can use, but the steps will be the same! Find the CentOS version [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-centos-7) and the Ubuntu version [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04)

* Digital Ocean's LAMP Stack How To's
   Guides for setting up your first webserver, there's a Centos [version](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-centos-7) and an Ubuntu [version](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04)

* Getting Started with AWS Documentation
   Amazon provides some good, if technical, documentation for getting started. You can sign up for a 'Free Tier' for 12 months and use these within limits. Try to pick a small instance! Find out about the free tier [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), and follow the guides to set up your first instance [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)

* Lifehacker Ubuntu Software Recommendations
   If you're running Ubuntu as a desktop OS try out some of Lifehackers recommended apps from [here](http://lifehacker.com/lifehacker-pack-for-linux-our-list-of-the-essential-li-815376368)

* General Systems Explainers - Julia Evans
   Julia Evans runs a blog that has a mix of very complicated debugging and also very useful simple guides to systems components. I recommend her drawings series, especially on Networking, which you can find [here](http://jvns.ca/)
